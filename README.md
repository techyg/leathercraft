A repository for some of my leather files.

**Guitar Pick Keychain.pdf** - This is a PDF file you can use in a laser cutter (eg. Glowforge) that is based off the design here, from Kobe Beefy.

**1.5GregBelt-1 **- You can use this to generate a template to cut the end of a belt.
**1.5GregBelt-2** - This is the file for the other end that has the buckle.

**Leather-RoundCoaster.pdf** - A great starting point for a round coaster with stiching holes. I have laser cut and hand cut several of these, and I usually back them with felt.
